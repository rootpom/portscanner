```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clear, concise code
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Follow Python best practices (PEP 8)

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Test on different targets (localhost, valid hosts)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate

**Example:**
```python
def scan_port(target: str, port: int) -> bool:
    """
    Scan a single port on the target host.
    
    Args:
        target: IP address or hostname to scan
        port: Port number to check
        
    Returns:
        True if port is open, False otherwise
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Adding New Features

When adding features:
- Keep it simple and maintainable
- Don't add unnecessary dependencies
- Make features optional when possible
- Update the README with usage examples
- Add error handling

### Testing

Before submitting:
- Test on multiple Python versions (3.6+)
- Test on different operating systems if possible
- Test both valid and invalid inputs
- Test error conditions

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add inline comments for complex code
- Update usage examples
- Keep documentation clear and concise
