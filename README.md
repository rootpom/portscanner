# Simple Port Scanner

A lightweight, easy-to-use port scanner written in Python for network diagnostics and security testing.

## Features

- üöÄ Fast and efficient TCP port scanning
- üéØ Scan specific hosts by IP or hostname
- ‚è±Ô∏è Configurable timeout settings
- üìä Clear scan results and progress tracking
- üîß Easy to customize port ranges
- üíª Simple command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses standard library only)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-port-scanner.git
cd simple-port-scanner
```

2. Make the script executable (optional):
```bash
chmod +x port_scanner.py
```

## Usage

Run the scanner:
```bash
python port_scanner.py
```

When prompted, enter the target IP address or hostname:
```
Enter target IP or hostname: 192.168.1.1
```

The scanner will display open ports as it finds them:
```
Scanning target: 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)
Time started: 2025-10-01 10:30:45.123456

--------------------------------------------------
Port 22: OPEN
Port 80: OPEN
Port 443: OPEN
--------------------------------------------------

Scan completed at 2025-10-01 10:31:52.789012
Found 3 open port(s)
```

## Customization

### Changing Port Range

Edit the `main()` function to modify the port range:
```python
start_port = 1      # First port to scan
end_port = 1024     # Last port to scan
```

### Adjusting Timeout

Modify the timeout in the `scan_port()` function:
```python
sock.settimeout(1)  # Change to desired timeout in seconds
```

### Scanning Specific Ports

Replace the range loop with a list of specific ports:
```python
ports_to_scan = [21, 22, 80, 443, 3306, 8080]
for port in ports_to_scan:
    if scan_port(target_ip, port):
        print(f"Port {port}: OPEN")
```
